In this small python project you can get user inputs to create a username and a password associated to that specific username, store the data into a json file which will allow us to either welcome back a previous user or create a new user. 

## Imports 
Given the simplicity of this projects we only need one import, a 'json' import which we use to store the usernames and passwords.

Feel free to download the code to add features like having a secret message for each user or have a random password generator for each user, adding this and have it shown in a desktop GUI would be good practise. 

## Results 
Below is the result of our first user being created and the json file containing our data.
