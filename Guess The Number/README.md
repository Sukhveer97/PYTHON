# Guess The Number 

This is a very simple python project which you ask the user to guess the number the program has chosen at random, you are given 5 guesses to guess the correct number.

## Imports 
The only import thats needed for this is 'random', this will allow us to have the number we need to guess be randomly generated, I called this variable the 'secretnumber', we can also specify the range we want this number to be, I decided to pick a range from 1 to 20.

Simple if...else statements are then needed when the user inputs their guess, we can respond with one of four responses, one for if it is too high, one for too low, one if they guess correctly and the last being if they run out of guesses. 

Feel free to download the code and implement other things such as a retry function, or a 'remaining guesses left' counter.
